		</a>	
		Ninja vs Game is a local-multiplayer-PvP.game. It has been a childhood dream to make a game, where one player controls the player and another controls the boss.

		I have been really fascinated by the concept of code changing itself, so I attempted to make a game about it.

		</a>	
Snail Trails was made at Global Game Jam 2014. It is a game about two snails, who has to cooperate in order to reach their goals. I really want to make an action game with this mechanic.

		</a>	
Alex is my Autumn-vacation-project. I believe it is a four dimensional system represented in two dimensions, it sounds really complicated but it isn't. I have had the idea for a couple of months and decided to make the game while learning some Unity.

		</a>	Relations is my most experimental game.<br />
	My goal was to create symbolism through simple game mechanics, <br />
	and through the discovery of these.

			<div class="overskrift">DuoBall</div>
		</a>
			DuoBall is the first game I have finished making.<br />
			It is a cooperation game for your brainsides.<br />
			The player has to control two balls, one with each hand. My idea was to force the player into moving the balls asynchronous yet coordinated.

		</a>
			This is my final project from Vallekilde Højskole. <br />
			It was made in a small team, we wanted to make an exploration/ambience game. 
			The player controls a small swarm of underwater fireflies through some simple puzzles. <br />

			The game was made at "Exile Game Jam 2012". <br />
			It is a local multiplayer game where each player controls a ninja. A ninja is invisible while moving, the goal of the game is to revael the other players by throwing paint at them. <br />

			A game made at Vallekilde Højskole. We were given the task to make two levels. The first level had to introduce a mechanic without text, the second level would have the player use this mechanic. We failed pretty miserably.<br />
