<h2>An exhibition in communication between man and machine without text (With text)</h2><br />		

A game made at Vallekilde Højskole. We were given the task to make two levels. The first level had to introduce a mechanic without text, the second level would have the player use this mechanic. We failed pretty miserably.<br />
